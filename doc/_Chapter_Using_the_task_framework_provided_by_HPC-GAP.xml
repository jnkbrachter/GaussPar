<Heading>Using the task framework provided by HPC-GAP</Heading>

<P/>
To implement our parallel version of the Gauss algorithm we use the task
framework provided by HPC-GAP.
The structure of the source files reflects this by grouping our functions
depending on how they make use of HPC-GAP's shared memory model.

<Item>
<Code>main.gi</Code>:
  Contains the main function <Code>DoEchelonMatTransformationBlockwise</Code>, which
  is wrapped by <Ref Func="EchelonMatBlockwise"/> and
  <Ref Func="EchelonMatTransformationBlockwise"/>.
  It is the function which schedules all tasks.

<List>
<Item>
<Code>dependencies.g</Code>:
  The functions in this file compute the dependencies of the algorithm's
  subprograms between each other.

<List>
<Item>
<Code>tasks.g</Code>:
  The functions in this file are scheduled as tasks by the main routine.
  They need to make sure that they only write read-only objects into the "shared"
  atomic lists.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
<Code>thread-local.g</Code>:
  The functions in this file are called by functions from "tasks.g".
  In principle, these functions only work in a single thread-local region and
  don't need to know anything about other threads.
  These functions may only access read-only objects or objects from the
  executing thread's thread-local region.
  They may only emit or write into thread-local objects.
