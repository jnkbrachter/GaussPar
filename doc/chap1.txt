  [33X[0;0YThis package implements the algorithm described in "A parallel algorithm for
  Gaussian  elimination  over  finite fields" (Linton, S., Nebe, G., Niemeyer,
  A.,  Parker,  R.  and  Thackray,  J.  (2018)). The algorithm divides a given
  matrix  into  smaller  submatrices  (blocks)  and  carries  out steps of the
  Gaussian  elimination  block  by  block.  The  paper  identifies the minimal
  dependencies  between  processing different blocks. Independent steps can be
  performed  simultaneously,  allowing  for  high  levels  of  parallelism. We
  provide    two    main    functions    [2XEchelonMatBlockwise[102X    ([14X2.1-2[114X)    and
  [2XEchelonMatTransformationBlockwise[102X  ([14X2.1-1[114X),  where  the  latter additionally
  computes  the  transformation matrix in parallel. The naming conventions are
  chosen   in   accordance  with  the  "Gauss"-package  ,  which  provides  an
  implementation of the sequential GAUSS algorithm. Our functions do currently
  not support sparse matrices.[133X
